      Welcome to the Dice Word Guessing Game! Players take turns rolling the dice to guess a randomly selected word. Once the dice shows faces 1 , 5 or 6, the player can input a letter to fill in the blanks for the word. Each correct guess brings them closer to victory. The game automatically switches to the next player after each turn. The first player to successfully complete the word wins the round. Good luck and have fun!</p></div>
